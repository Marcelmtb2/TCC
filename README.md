18-nov -> 1st commits of initial code.

Only Background subtraction is barely at basic functional state.
Some background noise and a lot of shadow movements are interfering with the extracted contours. More work
is needed

More experiments will be made in code for Contour Detection and HSV Histogram, as them seem easier and 
faster to progress

Following initial work, testing Feature Matching will be the next step.

At last, Kalman filter and Optical flow seemed harder to understand. They are listed as alternatives to explore.
