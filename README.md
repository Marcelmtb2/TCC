- HSV Histogram
- Feature Matching*
- Kalman Filter*
- Optical FLow*

## Journal

18-nov -> 1st commits of initial code.

Only Background subtraction is barely at basic functional state.
Some background noise and a lot of shadow movements are interfering with the extracted contours. More work is needed.

More experiments will be made in code for Contour Detection and HSV Histogram, as them seem easier and 
faster to progress

Following initial work, testing Feature Matching will be the next step.

At last, Kalman filter and Optical flow seemed harder to understand. They are listed as alternatives to explore.

# Boris Annotation Tools
It was used an open-source application named BORIS, intended to be used as an annotation tool for biological and animal behaviour. it generates an
.boris file, resembling an .json, with organized metadata alongside the
annotations themselves.

That annotation file can be exported into other formats.

After some basic editing, removing unnecessary metadata, the exported
annotations are in the following google spreadsheet:
